# Discussion Question: Event Delegation

## Objectives
* Practice adding event listeners and manipulating the DOM
* Utilize event delegation

## Kitten Candyland
Today, we'll practice manipulating the DOM. Clone down this repo, and open `index.html`. You should see a page with a bunch of cats! Open `index.js` and review the code that is provided for you. As a group, your goal will be to meet the deliverables listed below. Write your solution in `index.js`.

## Deliverables

1. When a user click son the header at the top, it should turn blue.
For this deliverable, you will need to change the `className` of the header to `ui blue header center aligned`.

##### For deliverables 2 & 3, use event delegation to achieve the following:
*HINT: You will need to use the same event listener to accomplish both. How can use the `data-action` attributes here?*

2. When a user clicks on the name of any cat, it should turn green.
For this deliverable, you will need to change the `className` of the div that holds the cat's name to `ui header green`.

3. When a user clicks on the like icon, it should increase the number of likes by 1.
*HINT: how can we use the `data-id` attribute to locate the correct cat?*
